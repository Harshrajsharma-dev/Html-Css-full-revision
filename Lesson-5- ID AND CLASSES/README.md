ðŸ”– ID and Classes in HTML
ID Attribute <br>
â€¢ The id attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element. <br>
â€¢ It must be unique within a page â€” no two elements can have the same id. <br>
â€¢ Used in CSS to apply styles to one specific element. <br>
â€¢ Also used in JavaScript to access and manipulate that element. <br>
â€¢ Syntax: id="uniqueName" <br>

Class Attribute <br>
â€¢ The class attribute is used to group multiple elements for styling or scripting. <br>
â€¢ Multiple elements can share the same class. <br>
â€¢ One element can also have multiple classes by separating them with spaces. <br>
â€¢ Used in CSS to apply styles to a group of elements. <br>
â€¢ Also used in JavaScript to manipulate elements with the same class. <br>
â€¢ Syntax: class="className" or class="class1 class2" <br>

Key Differences <br>
â€¢ id is unique, class is reusable. <br>
â€¢ Use id when you need to target a single element. <br>
â€¢ Use class when you want to apply the same style or behavior to multiple elements. <br>
